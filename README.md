## 📝 About the Eisenhower Matrix

The Eisenhower Matrix helps you prioritize tasks by categorizing them into four quadrants:

- **Q1 (Do First)**: Urgent & Important - Handle immediately
- **Q2 (Schedule)**: Important, Not Urgent - Plan and focus here
- **Q3 (Delegate)**: Urgent, Not Important - Minimize or delegate
- **Q4 (Eliminate)**: Neither - Consider eliminating
